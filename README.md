I'm someone who loves understanding how things *really* work at a low level.  
Have you ever tried printing `Hello, World` in C **without `printf`**…  
or printing `"hello world"` **without the string ever appearing in your codebase**?

Yeah, I enjoy that kind of stuff.

I'm a B.Tech student, a YouTube creator, and someone who spends a lot of time exploring
the internals of systems — compilers, interpreters, memory, operating systems, and how
programs behave under the hood.

I write code because I’m curious, not because I have to.
And every day, I try to push one layer deeper into how computers actually work.
